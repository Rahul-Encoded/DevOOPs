# üöÄ End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline using Azure DevOps

## üîó Pipeline Overview

```
Developer Code ‚Üí Azure Repos (Git) ‚Üí Build Pipeline (CI) ‚Üí Publish Artifact ‚Üí Release Pipeline (CD) ‚Üí Deploy to Staging ‚Üí Approvals ‚Üí Quality Gates ‚Üí Deploy to Production ‚Üí Swap Slots (Blue-Green)
```

This is a modern **Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)** pipeline that uses **Azure DevOps** to automate building, testing, and deploying applications.

## üß± Azure DevOps Components Involved

| Component             | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Azure Repos (Git)** | Source control where application code is stored |
| **Build Pipeline (CI)** | Automates building and testing code |
| **Artifacts**         | Output of the build (e.g., compiled app, Docker image, static files) |
| **Release Pipeline (CD)** | Deploys build output to various environments like Staging or Production |
| **Approvals & Checks** | Manual or automated gates before deployment |
| **Quality Gates**     | Automated checks powered by Azure Monitor and Application Insights |
| **Blue-Green Deployment** | Zero-downtime deployment strategy using two environments |

## üîÑ Blue-Green Deployment Strategy

### What is Blue-Green Deployment?

It's a **zero-downtime deployment strategy** where:
- One version of the app is live (**Blue**)
- A new version is deployed to an isolated environment (**Green**)
- Once validated, traffic is switched from Blue to Green

### Why Use It?
- No downtime during deployments
- Easy rollback if something goes wrong
- Safe way to test changes in production-like environment

### Visual Representation

![image](Assets\SWAP.png)

```
Version 1.0:     [Blue APP] ‚Üê Live Traffic
Version 2.0:     [Green APP] ‚Üê New Deployment

Swap Triggered:
Traffic rerouted to Green ‚Üí Green becomes new Blue
Old Blue can be reused or deleted
```

### In Azure App Service

You can implement this using **Deployment Slots**:
- `Production` slot (default)
- `Staging` slot (for testing)

Once tested, you can **swap** the slots.

## üõ†Ô∏è Azure Release Pipeline (CD) Flow

Here‚Äôs how the release pipeline works based on your document:

```
Get Artifacts ‚Üí Deploy to Staging ‚Üí Run Tests ‚Üí Approval Required ‚Üí Quality Gate Check ‚Üí Deploy to Production ‚Üí Swap Slots
```

### Phases of Release Pipeline

1. **Get Artifacts**
   - Pulls the built application from the Build Pipeline
   - Usually a `.zip`, static files, or container image

2. **Deploy to Staging**
   - Deploys the artifact to a staging environment (e.g., Azure Web App Slot)

3. **Run Tests**
   - Automated smoke tests or integration tests

4. **Manual Approval**
   - Optional: Requires team member approval before proceeding

5. **Quality Gates**
   - Monitors health via Application Insights
   - Fails the deployment if unhealthy metrics are detected

6. **Deploy to Production**
   - Deploys to the production slot or swaps with staging

7. **Slot Swap**
   - Swaps staging and production slots to go live

## üõ°Ô∏è What Are Quality Gates in Azure Releases?

### Definition:
**Quality Gates** are automated checks that validate the health of your application before allowing a deployment to proceed.

They use data from **Azure Monitor** and **Application Insights** to check for issues such as:

- High failure rate
- Long response times
- Exceptions
- Dependency failures

### How It Works

1. You define a **baseline** (like average performance over last 5 days)
2. Before deployment, Quality Gates compare current metrics against baseline
3. If anomalies are detected, deployment fails automatically

### Benefits
- Prevent bad releases from going live
- Reduce risk of outages
- Improve reliability of deployments

### Enabling Quality Gates in Azure

To enable Quality Gates:
1. Go to **Azure Portal > Application Insights**
2. Enable **Smart Detection Rules**
3. In **Azure DevOps Release Pipeline**, add a **Pre-deployment Condition**
4. Select **Query Performance Anomalies (Preview)** under "Gates"

### Example Rule:
> ‚ÄúFail deployment if request failure rate increases by more than 50%‚Äù
